### Leaderboard Scene
This scene lists the top 10 scores played so far in the game. All game scores are stored in a [Leaderboard API](https://us-central1-js-capstone-backend.cloudfunctions.net/api/) endpoint created particularly for this game.

The game sends all the scores to the endpoint along with your player name, after a game is over. If you make it to the first ten, you will see your score in the `Top Scores` list.

- You'll need to be connected to the Internet while in the `Leaderboard` scene in order to view the `Top Scores` list
